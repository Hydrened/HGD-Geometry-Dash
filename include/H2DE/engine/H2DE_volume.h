 * 
 * This file declares the H2DE_Volume class, responsible for controlling audio playback,
 * pause/resume logic, volume settings, and more, within the context of the H2DE game engine.
 * 
 * It handles both songs (usually played on channel 0) and sound effects (played on dynamic channels),
 * and supports pause-sensitive audio for in-game pausing logic.

/**
 * @class H2DE_Volume
 * @brief Audio system for managing songs and sound effects in H2DE.
 * 
 * This class wraps SDL_mixer to provide simple and flexible playback of music and sound effects.
 * It allows playing, stopping, pausing, and resuming sounds across different channels.
 * 
 * Supports:
 * - Channel-based playback (channel 0 is reserved for songs)
 * - Pause-sensitive logic (sounds can auto-pause/resume when the game does)
 * - Volume control for both songs and SFX
 * - Integration with H2DE_Engine and asset management
 * 
 * Only one song is expected to be played at a time, while multiple sound effects can play simultaneously.
 * Internally manages chunk caching and playback tracking.
